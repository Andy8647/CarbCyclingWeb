Place your social preview image here as `og.png` (recommended size 1200x630).

During build, the app sets `<meta property="og:image" content="/og.png">` via env or runtime. If you prefer to host elsewhere,
set `VITE_OG_IMAGE` to an absolute URL (e.g., https://example.com/og.png) in your environment.
