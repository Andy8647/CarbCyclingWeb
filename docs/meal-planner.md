# Meal Planner Notes

- The food selector in each meal slot supports quick-adding new ingredients directly from the dropdown. Choose "Quick add food" to create an item without leaving the planner.
- Every food entry captures whether macros were recorded at a raw or cooked weight so users can match their tracking preference.
- Foods can include an emoji to improve scanning in the dropdown, library, and assigned meal slots.
- the day colunn becomes too messy, we can start from a basic day meals template and provide a "+" icon to let users modify on their own
- the food library is not i18n yet
- to add a new option, I want to use a Popup instead of the current solution
- on desktop view, user can also toggle to see/hide the day meal slots
- the "Day X" on mobile view is wrong, it should always be the index+1 of the postion of that card no matter how user drag it
